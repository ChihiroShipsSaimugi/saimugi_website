                <p class = "fanfictiontext">
                    <p>Shuichi was in the Casino, he had just finished playing some games, and had won a considerable amount of coins. Kaito encouraged him to spend some time in the area, to help him recover from losing Kaede in the last class trial. Shuichi still felt sad, but the Casino games helped him take his mind off of the current situation they were in. As he collected his coins, Shuichi made his way to the casino shop, to see if there was anything he wanted to buy.</p>

                    <p>As he looked at the different Monopad skins, one of them seemed off. It looked like a normal Monopad, and its price was only one coin. After thinking about it for a moment, Shuichi purchased the Monopad. After receiving the item, he noticed it had a card taped to the back of it, but he chose to check the Monopad first. As he turned the power on, the device flashed on, it seemed to be loading something, like it was its first time turning on.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the screen loaded, it displayed the details of the owner of the device. Most of the areas of data were completely blank, except for the name field having the words "TEAM DANGANRONPA INC." Was this Monopad unused? Shuichi thought about it for a moment, choosing to explore the contents of the device first. He scrolled through the Monopad, most of it was blank or inaccessible, however Shuichi did find a page with the title "54_SURVIVOR_PERK." He wondered what this meant, a survivor.. perk? For surviving what? Why was this here? The questions lingered in his mind.</p>
                    
                    <p>The page was almost completely blank, however there was some text at the top. It read "DO NOT DISTRIBUTE" and then the sentence "Purpose â€” Library door tip." It was cryptic, if anything. The words didn't make much sense to Shuichi, however he could understand that "Library door" was likely referring to the secret door in the library. As he turned the Monopad around, he ripped off the keycard. Shuichi had remembered the card slot next to the door, and he decided to test the card on it.</p>
                    
                    <p>He quickly left the Casino with the two objects, making his way to the library. Shuichi passed by some other classmates, but his curiosity and interest in the device compelled him to ignore them. As he entered the library, he rushed to the secret door, opening the bookshelf as the large white door towered over him. Shuichi dusted off the key reader and then pulled out the keycard, sliding it into the reader.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nothing happened for a moment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Suddenly, the door's light flashed red, a loud creaking noise filled Shuichi's ears as the door opened. The entrance was dark, and he cautiously stepped inside, his shoes making a loud tapping sound on the concrete as he stepped inside. Before he could react, the door behind him closed, leaving him stuck in the darkness. Shuichi touched the wall, using his senses to try to find the light switch. As he moved along it, he could.. sense something. He could sense it get closer, and each time he took a step, he could hear something else making quiet steps.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shuichi found the light switch, raising his hand to turn it on, but he froze as he heard something. It was soft, quiet breathing, and it wasn't his. The breathing was right behind him, and he could barely make it out. Steeling his nerves, and calming himself, he turned on the light switch and turned around.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Hello there, Shuichi!" Tsumugi said as she raised a shot put ball.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shuichi only saw darkness.</p>
                    
                    <p>***</p>
                    
                    <p>He slowly opened his eyes. Shuichi realized he was in a chair, but as he tried to stand up, he felt his arms and legs constricted. He looked down to see his arms tied to the armrests of the chair, his legs similarly tied to the legs of the chair. "H-Huh..?" Shuichi mumbled as he struggled in his binds, trying to get out of them. He looked around the room, it didn't look that bad, but the style of the area was completely different from the Academy he knew. There was a marble checkerboard style floor, with a red wall and ceiling.</p>
                    
                    <p>A ceiling light illuminated the area, casting light on him. Shuichi was confused, what is going on? Why is he here? Why is he tied up? He remembered seeing Tsumugi just before he passed out, and despite his mind feeling disoriented, he slowly began to piece together what was happening. He felt a great pain on his head, as if something hit him, and being unable to rub it irritated Shuichi. "Hello..?" He called out, hoping that someone would find him. His prayers were answered as he heard a door behind him open. Shuichi tried to look back, but his head could only turn so much, and he was left completely vulnerable to whatever was behind him.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Good morning, Shuichi." He heard a female voice say as the sound of shoes clacking made their way towards him. "W-Who's there?" Shuichi replied in a confused voice. "Am I really that plain that you don't remember me? Aw.." The source of the sound walked around his chair to face him.</p>
                    
                    <p>It was Tsumugi.</p>
                    
                    <p>"T-Tsumugi!?" Shuichi exclaimed in a surprised voice, he was even more confused now. "W-What's going on? Can you untie me?" He asked, though he could tell something was off. "Ah.. I'm afraid I can't do that, Shuichi." Tsumugi smiled creepily, she had a hand behind her back, as if she was hiding something. "H-Huh? Why not? I.." Shuichi thought about it for a moment, his mind returning as it all clicked in his head. "You're.. You're the mastermind." He said in a somber tone. "Did it really take you that long to realize?" She seemed sad, but then she started giggling.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Ah, whatever, now you know." Tsumugi put a finger to her lips, as she seemed to be contemplating something. "What are you going to do to me?" Shuichi asked, he was terrified, but he wanted to try to show some sort of confidence. "Thanks for reminding me, I almost forgot why I came in here, heh." She chuckled like she made some sort of honest mistake. Shuichi shrunk in his seat, he tried a few more times to break out of the ropes. "Don't bother trying to resist, it'll just make things worse." Tsumugi walked up next to him, planting a hand on his hair.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shuichi felt uncomfortable, very uncomfortable. He shivered at her touch, his mind racing with a thousand different thoughts. "Hmm.. your ahoge is quite nice, do you mind if I modify it a bit?" Tsumugi asked in a playful voice. "I.. uh.. no..? I don't th-"</p>
                    
                    <p>*Snip!*</p>
                    
                    <p>Shuichi winced as he felt some of his hair being cut. "W-What are you doing!?" He exclaimed, looking up to see Tsumugi holding scissors. "I'm just making you look better!" Tsumugi said as she grabbed his head, forcing his head down as she snipped off the end of his ahoge. *Snip!* Shuichi winced more at the feeling. "S-Stop!" He cried in pain as she kept snipping. "Don't *Snip!* be such a *Snip!* big *Snip!* baby! It'll regrow anyways! *Snip!*" Shuichi cried in pain, feeling tears well up as he struggled with all his might against his binds, to no avail.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tsumugi stopped cutting, caressing his ahoge, which had now been shortened in half. "Aww.. was that too much?" She said in a mocking voice. "P-Please.. stop.." Shuichi replied weakly. "Why? This is so much fun!" Tsumugi pouted, "Fine.. let's move on." Shuichi's eyes widened at her words. "H-Huh? M-Move on?" He said in a frightened voice. "Yeah, surely you didn't think I would stop after just one haircut, right?" She giggled as she walked behind him, and he could hear her rummaging through objects on a table. Tsumugi grabbed the object she needed, and then she walked back around to him.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Here we go." Tsumugi pulled out the item she brought, a needle with a small and sharp point. "Let's see how much blood you have in that adorable body of yours, hmm?" Shuichi stared at her in fear, struggling against her binds. He was terrified, his mind thought of home, his friends in the Academy, his family, Kaede. Tsumugi walked to his side, holding the needle up. "Hmm, it appears there's a blouse in the way of my needle, I must fix that." She yanked up his sleeve, exposing his arm. "T-Tsumugi! P-Please, d-don't do this! I-I.." Shuichi pleaded with her, which only caused her to giggle more. "Shh.. just relax, it'll be quick." Without giving him any time to react, Tsumugi plunged the needle into his arm, eliciting a cry of pain from Shuichi.</p>
                    
                    <p>She filled the needle with his blood, pulling it out. Shuichi cried quietly, tears dripping down his face as he whimpered. "There we go.. that wasn't so bad, was it?" Tsumugi pulled over a bucket, depositing the blood into it. "But.. that's not it, I'll keep extracting blood until this bucket is full, it'll be a real test! Like something in one of my animes!" Tsumugi laughed to herself as she raised the needle again. "N-No! Please! No more..! I don't..!" Shuichi cried as tears poured down his face. "I'm sorry Shuichi, but it's not really your choice." Tsumugi replied with a smile.</p>
                    
                    <p>She plunged the needle into his arm again, eliciting more whimpers as she deposited the blood in the bucket. Tsumugi kept doing this over and again, each time causing Shuichi to moan and cry in pain. Shuichi soon lost count, his eyes fluttering shut and open as he felt the blood loss, his body feeling weaker with every extraction. "Nnh.. stop.." He protested weakly as he slumped back into the chair. "Is it already getting to be too much? Don't worry, I'm almost done!" Tsumugi exclaimed as she kept extracting his blood.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shuichi felt exhausted, his body was on the verge of collapse as he kept losing blood. He found it hard to keep his eyes open, his body feeling out of his control as he whimpered, running out of tears to cry.</p>
                    
                    <p>"There we go, all done!" Tsumugi exclaimed. She dragged the bucket full of his blood infront of his chair, pushing his head down to force him to look at it. Shuichi almost vomited at the sight, however he felt too weak to speak. "Not gonna say anything, huh? I guess that's alright." Tsumugi walked behind him again, coming back with a small cup. She dipped the cup into the bucket of blood, putting it to her lips as she took a sip. "Mmh.. delicious." Shuichi felt even more sick as he tried to look away, however Tsumugi just kept following his vision.</p>
                    
                    <p>After she drank half of the cup, she moved closer to him, leaning down. "Want a sip? It tastes good." She asked him with a smile. "N-No.." He replied weakly. "Too bad, I wasn't really giving you a choice." She pressed the cup of blood to his lips, forcing his lips open as she pushed the cup into his mouth. "M-Mmh..! Nnh..!!" Shuichi made muffled sounds of protest, feeling his own blood pour into his mouth as the liquid was forced down his throat, making him drink it.</p>
                    
                    <p>It tasted horrible, Shuichi could feel the last of his tears drip down his face as he squirmed in his binds, wishing that someone would come and save him from this hell. Tsumugi poured the rest of the cup into his mouth, ensuring that he swallowed every drop. "There we go, I hope you liked it as much as me." She smiled as she threw the cup away. "You seem tired already, but I can't just keep you here, so.." She thought for a moment, walking to her table before coming back with a flashlight.</p>
                    
                    <p>"I'll store this little experience in here, you won't remember a single thing." Before he could respond, she turned the flashlight on, filling Shuichi's mind with a blank space as he felt his existence crumbling, his body feeling like it was on fire. He tried to open his mouth, but he couldn't make a sound as the light filled his head.</p>
                    
                    <p>"I'll see you soon, Shuichi."</p>
                    
                    <p>***</p>
                    
                    <p>Shuichi sat up in bed, he felt weak and tired. He had the wildest dream, yet he couldn't remember it. He climbed out of bed, getting dressed as he looked at himself in the mirror. His ahoge.. looked noticeably shorter, not only that, but his throat also felt dry. "Huh..?" He thought to himself. Maybe it was always that way? Shuichi wondered. After hearing the morning announcement, he exited his room, making his way to the dining area.</p>
                    
                    <p>As he entered, he could see all his friends eating breakfast happily, however his eyes darted to one of them, Tsumugi.</p>
                    
                    <p>A feeling of dread and fear filled him as he stared at her, yet he couldn't understand why.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tsumugi smirked subtly at him.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Good morning, Shuichi."</p>
