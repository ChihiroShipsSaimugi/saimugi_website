            <h4>Not So Innocent Offer (Author: ChihiroShipsSaimugi):</h4>
            <h4 class = "rating">Rating: Explicit</h3>
                <p>Tsumugi pulled Shuichi along to her Ultimate Lab, as the Ultimate Cosplayer, her lab was a large gray room with multiple sets for different scenes. One of these was a bar, based off of a previous job she used to have as a bartender. Tsumugi explained to him why the set existed, and she loosened her blazer a bit as she walked around to the bartender side of the table. "So.. Shuichi. Would you like a drink?" Tsumugi offered with a smile, looking around and touching the many drinks and bottles that were stored on the long shelf.</p>

                <p>"Uh.. I don't think I can drink yet.." Shuichi replied. "Wait, how did you work as a bartender if you are also a highschooler?" He questioned. "Ah, don't worry about it. Just know that I was the best at it..!" Tsumugi replied with a giggle, grabbing one of the bottles and pulling out a thin glass. "Cmon, let me make you something. It'll be non-alcoholic if you care so much about drinking laws." Tsumugi said as she fluttered her eyes at him. "Well.. if it's non-alcoholic, then I guess I could have one." Shuichi replied as he sat down at one of the stools.</p>
                
                <p>"There we go..! I'll get one drink for you right away!" She exclaimed happily as she turned to the racks of bottles. "I'll make one of my signature cocktails for you.." Tsumugi said as she made the drink. With her back turned to Shuichi, she reached into her pocket, pulling out a small pink pill. She crushed it up in her hand and let the crumbs fall into the drink. Tsumugi quickly shook the glass in order to make the pill disappear into it. "There we go.. all done.." She turned around with the now finished drink, making sure that Shuichi didn't see her spiking it.</p>
                
                <p>Tsumugi passed the drink over to Shuichi. "I used to make a lot of money getting donations from my customers." She explained. "I would always say: I'm a struggling artist who needs funds, would you please donate?" Tsumugi giggled as she spoke in a sultry and soft voice, prompting Shuichi to blush slightly. "Ah.. I can see why people would donate so often.." He replied slowly as he picked up the drink, looking into it. "So.. this is non-alcoholic, right..?" Shuichi asked. "Yup! You don't have to worry about a thing!" Tsumugi replied with a smile, watching him.</p>
                
                <p>Shuichi brought the drink to his lips, taking a long sip. "Nnh.." He put the drink down as he swallowed the liquid. "So? How was it?" Tsumugi asked with a growing smirk. "I.. it was.. uh.. good.." Shuichi took another sip, and his eyelids fluttered for a moment as he put the drink down. "Ah.. did you.. what's.. in this..?" He asked in a slightly slurred voice. "Oh, it's nothing. I just added a little extra to make it taste so good." Tsumugi giggled as she leaned over the bar, pushing the drink towards him. "Finish it, Shuichi." Shuichi, at this point, was feeling very, very weird. However his clouded judgment persuaded him to finish it like she asked.</p>
                
                <p>"Uhm.. o-okay.." He replied slowly as he picked up the glass, drinking the rest of it down. "Nnh.." Shuichi whimpered, his eyes filling with a faint pink cloudiness. "How are you feeling, hmm?" Tsumugi reached her hand out, slowly caressing his hair as she tested the waters. "I.. I feel.. weird.. mmh.." Shuichi didn't seem to be resisting her advances, much to Tsumugi's enjoyment. "You don't feel too well? Here, why don't I help you?" She walked to his side, grabbing his wrist and pulling him to one of the sofas in the set. She sat down, pulling Shuichi with her and holding his head on her chest. "There we go, doesn't that feel good?" Tsumugi whispered in a soft and alluring voice as she ran her hand through his hair.</p>
                
                <p>"Y-Yes.. nnh.." Shuichi snuggled into her, making soft sounds of comfort. Tsumugi pulled Shuichi onto her lap, kissing his cheek as she giggled. "You're so adorable.. and cute.." She spoke in a sultry voice as she peppered his cheek and neck with small kisses. Shuichi blushed heavily at these actions, his breath starting to fasten. "T-Tsumugi.. I.. ah.." He let out a soft and quiet moan as Tsumugi moved her mouth onto his neck, ruffling his hair as she sucked on his skin. "Just.. relax.. and let me.." Tsumugi bit down on his neck, eliciting a pained moan of pleasure from Shuichi.</p>
                
                <p>"Nnh..!" Shuichi moaned and whimpered as Tsumugi planted small bites on his neck, leaving multiple bruises and marks on his skin. She pulled away, rubbing his hair as she looked down at his saliva and mark covered neck. "There.. your neck looks a lot better now.." Tsumugi moved one of her hands down to his neck, rubbing the bite mark and eliciting more whimpers from the boy. She pushed Shuichi down onto the sofa, climbing over him as she planted her hands at his sides, trapping him under her. The boy stared up at her, blushing and breathing heavily as he moved his hands to her thighs.</p>
                
                <p>Tsumugi smiled as she felt his hands rub her thighs, prompting her to lean down and kiss his forehead. "Shuichi.. do you.. want me..?" She asked in a husky voice as she planted soft kisses on his head. "Y-Yes Tsumugi.. I.. I need you.." Shuichi replied with a whimper. Tsumugi didn't really care if he wasn't in the mental state to properly consent, as it<br />
                was enough for her. She moved her mouth down, bringing her body down on Shuichi as she smashed her lips against his, tightly holding his body as she pressed against him and kissed his mouth ferociously.</p>
                
                <p>"Nnh.. Tsumugi..!" Shuichi whimpered into her mouth as she grabbed his arms, holding them down to the sofa as she inserted her tongue into his mouth, feeling around his mouth as she felt his own tongue rubbing against hers. Tsumugi moaned softly, grinding her body against his as her chest pressed up against him. She pulled away after a minute, leaving both of them panting heavily as a line of saliva connected both of their mouths. "Mmh.. so.. tasty.." She whispered in his ear as Shuichi felt her warm breath against his cheek.</p>
                
                <p>Tsumugi was at a crossroads, and there were a few ways she could take this with him. She doubted Shuichi would complain about any of them, considering the state he was in. Tsumugi quickly decided to escalate things, and she ran her hands across his jacket, slowly unbuttoning it as she gazed seductively into his eyes. Shuichi's face went red as she parted his jacket, running her hands up and down his chest. "Ah.. I.. uhm.. are you s-sure about this..?" Shuichi asked in a meek voice. "Oh yes.. I am very, very sure about this Shuichi.." Tsumugi moved on to his shirt, unbuttoning it slowly in order to make him squirm.</p>
                
                <p>She parted his shirt, using her hands to massage his chest, causing Shuichi to moan in a soft and quiet voice. Tsumugi then parted her blazer, taking off her bowtie as she unbuttoned her shirt, letting it part itself as her chest gave itself some breathing room. Shuichi stared up at her breasts, which were only covered by a lacy bra. She could feel a tightening in his pants below her, and his eyes were filled with awe. "Cmon.. I know you want to touch them.." Tsumugi giggled as she grabbed his arm, moving it and putting his hand on her breast. Shuichi started to rub it, prompting her to let out a soft moan at the feeling.</p>
                
                <p>"There we go.. just like that.." Tsumugi leaned down, kissing him as she felt his hand squeeze her breast, eliciting another moan from her. Suddenly, she grabbed his arm, pinning it to his side again. "Huh..?" Shuichi squeaked out in surprise. "I let you have a little fun, but it's my turn now, Shuichi." Tsumugi spoke in an alluring and seductive tone, reaching behind her back and untying her bra, letting it fall down and exposing her chest to Shuichi's gaze. He tried to reach out his hand again, but she pushed it back down. "Hey, no touching, not yet." Tsumugi replied with a giggle.</p>
                
                <p>She ran her hands down to his pants, reaching her fingers in and clasping the insides of his boxers as she pulled both of them down slowly, making it a bit of a painful and teasing moment for Shuichi. Tsumugi licked her lips as she fully pulled down the boy's clothes, letting his erect member pop out into the air. "Nnh.. Tsumugi.." Shuichi whimpered as he felt his shaft twitching, like it was begging for attention. "My my, you seem excited." Tsumugi giggled as she poked his member, causing a drop of precum to spill out of him and glisten his tip.</p>
                
                <p>She leaned forward, teasing him as she licked the tip of his shaft with the end of her tongue, swallowing the bits of precum that came out of him. Shuichi whimpered at the teasing, his breath quickly starting to hasten. "Aww.. does someone not like being teased..?" Tsumugi said as she poked his member. "T-Tsumugi.. don't tease me like this.. please.." Shuichi replied as he looked forward to her. "Well.. since you asked so nicely.." Tsumugi moved her head down, planting kisses along his shaft as she ran her tongue up and down, eliciting multiple whimpers and moans from Shuichi. More precum spilled out of him as she licked it up, enjoying the salty and sweet taste of his semen.</p>
                
                <p>"Mmh.. you taste nice, hehe.." Tsumugi giggled as she practically tortured the poor boy with her teasing. She decided to end it by moving her mouth down onto his tip, sucking on it and the precum that spilled out of him into her mouth. "Ah.. Tsumugi.. Nnh..!" Shuichi moaned, he moved his hand up to her hair, however Tsumugi grabbed his wrist and pulled his arm back down to his side. Tsumugi pushed her head down more, taking most of his length in her mouth as she moaned and wrapped her tongue around his shaft, sucking up and down slowly.</p>
                
                <p>Shuichi's eyes rolled back as he moaned multiple times in quick succession, a bit of drool running out of his mouth at the feeling of Tsumugi's warm mouth and tongue pleasuring him. She bobbed her head up and down, going faster as Shuichi felt himself starting to get close to the point of climax. "T-Tsumugi..! N-Nnh..!" Shuichi whimpered as he felt himself about to climax, however the feeling of warmth around him was quickly taken away as Tsumugi pulled away from him, catching her breath and denying Shuichi release. "Sorry Shuichi.. did you think I was going to let it end right there? We haven't even gotten to the main part yet.." She smiled as she looked down at his twitching member, the boy looking like he was in extreme struggle as he whimpered in denial.</p>
                
                <p>Tsumugi grabbed and pulled up her skirt, letting Shuichi get a full view of her black and lacy panties. She tugged them down, exposing her entrance as she felt her face warm, letting her skirt go as she climbed over Shuichi and straddled his waist, looking down at his cute and needy face. "Shuichi.. are you ready?" Tsumugi teased as she smirked down at him. "Y-Yes Tsumugi.. p-please.." Shuichi replied in a needy and exasperated voice. She found his begging to be satisfactory, and she lifted herself above him, teasing his tip as she lowered her entrance down onto it, the feeling causing Tsumugi to bite her lip and moan. Shuichi whimpered more, and she could feel some of his precum spurting into her already.</p>
                
                <p>After taking a deep breath, Tsumugi slammed herself down onto him, moaning loudly as she felt his length fully enter her. "Nnh.. so.. good.. ah.." She looked down at Shuichi, who was similarly moaning and blushing at the warm feeling of her entrance wrapping around him. Tsumugi slowly began to ride up and down his shaft, moaning softly as she grabbed his hands, holding them tightly. She leaned down to Shuichi as she sped up, kissing the boy and inserting her tongue into his mouth as they both moaned together, their bodies pressing against one another.</p>
                
                <p>Shuichi instinctively thrusted upwards, wanting to feel more of her warmth as he felt himself melt into her, his mind completely lost in the pleasure as he moaned senselessly and let Tsumugi ravage his mouth. Tsumugi sped up, enjoying Shuichi's sounds of pleasure as she kissed him, her tongue visiting every corner of his mouth. Her rapid pace brought Shuichi once again to the point of release, feeling himself bubble up inside her as they held each other. Tsumugi noticed his quickened breath, breaking the kiss to whisper into his ear.</p>
                
                <p>"Come on Shuichi..! Give it to me, give me your passion..!" She exclaimed in a hastened voice, feeling herself reaching the point of climax as well. Shuichi thrust up one final time into her as he moaned loudly, his semen spurting out into Tsumugi as she held him tightly, pressing her lips against his. They both made sounds of pleasure as she climaxed with him, their orgasms mixing together in a mix of lust and passion. Tsumugi slowed down, lifting herself off of his shaft and resting on top of him as she cuddled the boy, kissing his neck softly. "S.. S-Shuichi.. nnh.." Tsumugi whimpered into his ear. "Ah.. I.. T-Tsumugi…" Shuichi whimpered back.</p>
                
                <p>She felt his seed slowly dripping out of her, the feeling of being filled putting Tsumugi in a state of bliss. Tsumugi whispered words of appreciation in Shuichi's ear, her breathing calming down as she wiped her forehead of sweat. Tsumugi could see how tired he was, and she knew that the pill she gave him earlier was likely starting to finish running through his body at this point. Leaning down, she grabbed another pill from her loose jacket, a gray one, which she threw into her mouth. Tsumugi quickly leaned down, kissing Shuichi and pushing the pill into his mouth. He didn't resist taking the pill, swallowing it instinctively.</p>
                
                <p>Shuichi quickly closed his eyes, falling asleep as the sound of his soft breathing filled the small set. She quickly got off of him, cleaning both of them up as she dressed herself, pulling her panties up and buttoning her shirt. Tsumugi did the same to Shuichi, wiping him down and dressing the sleeping boy the best she could. She didn't exactly think through how exactly she was meant to disguise this whole incident ever happening, but she quickly thought of something, and she carried his body back to the bar, sitting him up on the seat in front of it.</p>
                
                <p>Tsumugi went around to the other side, grabbing the same glass she made him drink earlier and starting to refill it, trying to make it look like how it was before she drugged him.</p>
                
                <p>***</p>
                
                <p>Shuichi opened his eyes.</p>
                
                <p>He saw Tsumugi making a cocktail in front of him, like he just asked.. or did he just ask..? He felt a sense of fatigue like he had suddenly fallen asleep and woken up, yet time seemed like it hadn't moved. Shuichi felt faint memories come back to him.. very lustful ones about him and Tsumugi.. doing very personal things to each other. He shook his head, telling himself to stop thinking about her in that way.</p>
                
                <p>Tsumugi turned to him.</p>
                
                <p>"Do you want it stronger, Shuichi?"</p>
